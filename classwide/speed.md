# Apex Speeds & VMax

placeholder text

not writing this whilst I'm tired at 7pm rip lmao

describe how apex speeds are significantly higher than real life

insert motec telemetry trace and comparison to real life if possible, using multiple tracks

then describe how top speeds are also significantly lower than real life at daytona, le mans and road america

again, use motec telemetry traces and compare to screenshots from real life videos if possible
