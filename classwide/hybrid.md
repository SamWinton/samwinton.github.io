the big question - does the additional hybrid power add onto the 520 kW of power or not?

this needs solid evidence to bunk or debunk this. I can't just rely on the IMSA.com article that states how the hybrid system was plug-and-play from the Mercedes F1 cars. *Whilst it feels extremely likely that it is indeed auxillary power*, I really need concrete, telemetry proof before I can start writing this page.
