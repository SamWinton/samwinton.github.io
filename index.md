# Mission Statement

**What is the purpose behind this?**

As of the 2023 Season 4 build release, iRacing have now launched all four LMDh cars that compete in the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship's GTP category, of which two currently also compete in the Hypercar class of the FIA World Endurance Championship:

- [Acura ARX-06](https://www.iracing.com/cars/acura-arx-06-gtp/)
- [BMW M Hybrid V8](https://www.iracing.com/cars/bmw-m-hybrid-v8-lmdh/)
- [Cadillac V-Series.R](https://www.iracing.com/cars/cadillac-v-series-r-gtp/)
- [Porsche 963](https://www.iracing.com/cars/porsche-963-gtp/)

It is no small thing to say that having all four cars licensed and modelled in such high detail, both in graphical, sonic and physical fidelity is incredible for a consumer sim. That being said, there are some valid criticisms to be levied, not only at individual cars on their own, but the class as a whole. These range from benign bugs to inaccuracies that fundamentally differ from how this class of car races in the real world.

To that end, this is an attempt to document *constructive* feedback towards developers and engineers behind these cars in an attempt to make these cars more true to life and to deal with issues along the way, whilst also retaining user friendliness and to not invalidate certain choices made by iRacing in the development of these cars. This also an attempt to publically catalogue things that may be known to iRacing staff but generally aren't known by the majority of the userbase as well. *Some of these issues may also be deliberate choices*, and cataloging these quirks is of benefit to us as end users.

In short, let's work together to make these cars both as accurate, and as enjoyable as possible for everyone.
